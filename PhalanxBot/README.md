# PhalanxBot

A bot I'm writting with very slow progress

## reltrack
* Reltrack is a tool to get twitter followers:
```
cp test.environment environment
# edit environment with your tokens
# edit reltrack-simple.pl with your username, or the username you're interested into
source environment
perl reltrack-simple.pl
```

You will end up with a file named `username-`+`time in seconds`+`.json` that contains all of twitter's reply
